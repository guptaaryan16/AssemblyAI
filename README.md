Here we present our Discord Bot "Assembly-Meeting Bot"

### Overview
The Assembly-Meeting-Bot helps manage your meetings on Discord, assists you with the dreaded MoMs (Minutes of Meetings) and comes with a lot of other features.
It has accessibility features to cater to the hearing-impaired. 
Our primary inspiration to go ahead with this bot was seeing the exponential growth in online meetings and the need to intelligently manage them, while also considering the differently-abled.

### Approach
We created a Discord Bot using [discord.py](https://discordpy.readthedocs.io/) from the Discord official Documentation.
Next we referred the AssemblyAI API docs and our knowledge of python to implement the discord bot. 
We have used [this](https://www.assemblyai.com/docs/audio-intelligence#topic-detection-iab-classification).
We hosted it on replit and our local server and ran it on our private discord server.

### What it does
The Bot uses the Assembly AI API and text compilation features along with discord api in order to build a bot that can attend a meeting and interact with the voice spoken in the meetings. Also it can help create meeting notes and MoMs in the chats.

### How it works
The Bot has a !help command to explain its functionalities. More of it's working is explained in our Video Demo
